# Clockwork
A game engine built on MonoGame with a focus on ease-of-use for simple pixel art games.

Its structure is based on a hybrid of GameMaker and HaxeFlixel, taking the best of both to create an ideal pixel art workflow.

## Status

Works, but barebones and not yet useful.

## Why?

I grew up with GameMaker and loved working with it for the 10 or so years that I used it, but I have become increasingy frustrated by its limitations, particularly with its built-in scripting language. Also, because GameMaker is a sandboxed environment, it lends itself to be difficult to extend. I desire the flexibility of a more robust, feature complete language like C#, and running my own engine gives me the ability to extend it in whatever way I want.

I have tried other engines like Godot, Unity, and HaxeFlixel, but either I run into core issues such as frame stuttering, or the engine itself doesn't have an ideal workflow for pixel art like I had with GameMaker. I will use such engines for other types of games, but for pixel art I need a better solution.

Unfortunately, not everything from GameMaker translates well to C#, and there were parts of the engine's architecture that I did not like working with. To alleviate this, I will be taking some inspiration from the HaxeFlixel game engine as well.
